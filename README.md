# Mistral AI Chatbot using Gradio

This Colab notebook demonstrates how to build a simple chatbot interface using the Mistral AI large language model and the Gradio library.

## Description

The notebook utilizes the `mistralai` library to access the Mistral AI API and the `gradio` library to create an interactive chat interface. Users can input messages, and the chatbot, powered by the Mistral large language model, will generate responses.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Libraries:**

2. 2. **Mistral API Key:**
   - Obtain an API key from the Mistral AI platform: https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys/
   - Replace `api_key = ":-)"` with your actual API key.

3. **Model Selection:**
   - Choose a Mistral model (e.g., `mistral-large-2402`) or explore other available models: https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/models/models_overview/
   - Update the `model` variable accordingly.

4. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Execute all cells in the notebook.
   - A Gradio interface will launch, allowing you to interact with the chatbot.

## Usage

- Type your message in the input box and press Enter.
- The chatbot will respond based on the Mistral model's understanding of your input.
- Continue the conversation by typing more messages.

## Additional Notes

- This notebook also includes a commented-out section for building a chatbot using Hugging Face's `transformers` library.
- You can uncomment and modify this section to experiment with different chatbot models from Hugging Face.
